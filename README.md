# 📋 Project Overview 

This project analyzes a large-scale retail dataset (6.4M+ sales transactions) from a global fashion brand.
It focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and KPI generation using SQL, with interactive visualization and insights built in Power BI.

## 🎯 Objectives
	•	To perform data transformation and aggregation using SQL views for optimized performance.
	•	To build dynamic dashboards in Power BI showcasing key retail metrics and business insights.
	•   To derive actionable patterns in sales, discounts, and customer behavior across multiple countries.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
	•	Docker – to host Microsoft SQL Server in an isolated containerized environment.
	•	Azure Data Studio – for SQL querying, transformation, and view creation.
	•	Power BI – for visualization, DAX-based calculations, and dashboard creation.
	•	Kaggle Dataset: Global Fashion Retail Sales.

## 🧱 SQL Highlights
	•	Created 15+ optimized views for modular data transformation.
	•	Designed KPIs for:
	•	Customer demographics (age, gender, location)
	•	Product performance (category, subcategory, size, production cost)
	•	Store and employee performance
	•	Discount impact on sales and profit trends
	•	Handled multi-currency conversion, profit computation, and monthly trend analysis.
