# Sales-Analysis
* This is a basic sales dashboard I created using Power BI. It shows how a companyâ€™s sales are doing across different regions, product categories, and months.
## What it shows 
* Total Sales: $120.55K
* Total Profit: $18.40K
* Total Quantity Sold: 1,136 units
* Sales by Region (East, West, North, South)
* Sales by Product Category (Groceries, Clothing, Electronics, Furniture)
* Sales trend from January to June
* Slicers to filter by region and product category
## Why I made it:
* I made this project to practice working with Power BI and learn how to visualize data in a clean and interactive way. It helped me understand how to use charts, filters, and KPIs to get useful insights from sales data.
